- add stats to each item (add "stats" to ChoiceItem and PersonalItem as a string)
- add a notes section for a Cube (add "notes" to PersonalItem as a string)
- add a button in the Cube modal for items that can store other items
  - this can popup an area where you can put the weight it can hold and a list of any items,
    so when you add an item, it can subtract from the overall weight
    (ex. efficient quiver can hold up to say 30 lbs and you place a longbow, 4lb, in it so it's 4/30, 26 left)
  - add "includes" to PersonalItem as an array
  - ~~a weight next to list of items and total weight on the bottom~~
